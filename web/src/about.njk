<h2>Why This Exists</h2>
<p>
  I have been a long-time beneficiary of the community sheet, coming back to it again and again to find great Etho moments across videos and streams.
  This project started as a simple idea: keep honoring that incredible community effort, while giving it a cleaner and easier experience to explore.
  It is built with appreciation both for the people who maintain the sheet and for Etho, whose work brought all of us here in the first place.
</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<p>
  This project uses a Python data pipeline (`sheet-pipeline`) plus an Eleventy static frontend (`web`).
  The pipeline exports sheet data, enriches YouTube/Twitch metadata, and writes JSON consumed by reusable Nunjucks templates.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
  Huge appreciation to the Google Sheet contributors who continuously collect, verify, and organize Etho appearance entries.
  This site depends on that effort and exists to make their work easier to browse and share.
